# Opting out of MTD

Customers who are in MTD on a voluntary basis can leave (opt out) at any time. When this happens the customer’s filing obligations will change from MTD (quarterly) to a single annual obligation due on 31 January following the end of the tax year - this is their final declaration.

Eligibility to opt out is determined on a tax year basis. For example, a customer can be mandated for the current year and voluntary for the next year, meaning the customer could opt out next year. A customer can opt out for the previous tax year if they signed up to MTD as a voluntary customer, then subsequently decided not to submit quarterly - opting out would allow the customer to file on an annual basis for that year.

The opt out service will not be available through an API.

* Customers can access the opt out service and see their changed obligations immediately from their HMRC online services account.
* Agents will use their Agent Services Account to access their client’s account. Changed obligations will also be viewable immediately in their software.

If the customer has submitted updates of business income and expenses (self-employment and/or property) through their software for the tax year they opt out of MTD, these updates will be deleted. The customer or their agent will receive a warning message to inform them that this is going to happen. The total business income and expenses (for the tax year) must then be submitted as part of the customer’s tax return before completing their final declaration.

If a customer is mandated to be in MTD, they will not be eligible to opt out. The opt out service will only be available in HMRC online services for eligible customers.
