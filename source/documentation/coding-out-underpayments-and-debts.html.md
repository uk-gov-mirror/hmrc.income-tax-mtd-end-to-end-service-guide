# Coding Out

When a Self Assessment customer receives PAYE income in addition to business income, HMRC will try to collect any tax owed on their final declaration through their tax code for the following tax year. However, if there is a change in the customer's tax code, it may no longer be possible to collect the tax owed using this method. As a result, any amount collected will be returned to the customer’s account.

Tax codes can change under different circumstances. For example, if the customer starts to receive the benefit of a company car, this will take priority and it may no longer be possible to collect the tax owed for the previous year’s final declaration for Self Assessment. Also, if a customer ceases their PAYE employment, it may no longer be possible to collect any tax owed through their tax code. For more restrictions on coding out, see [Pay your Self Assessment tax bill: Through your tax code](https://www.gov.uk/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/through-your-tax-code).

The coding out underpayments and debts endpoints in the [Self Assessment Accounts API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/) allow the customer to complete the following tasks: 

- view coding out underpayment and debt amounts
- create or amend coding out underpayment and debt amounts
- delete coding out underpayment and debt amounts

A customer can view the coded out Self Assessment underpayments stored by HMRC and the amount submitted for the previous tax year at any time. In software, this is done by calling the [Retrieve Coding Out Underpayments and Debt Amounts](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Coding-Out-Underpayments-and-Debts/paths/~1accounts~1self-assessment~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1collection~1tax-code/get) endpoint.

At the end of the tax year, the customer will review their calculations before submitting the final declaration. If the customer does not agree with the coded out amount in their calculation shown by HMRC, they can submit what they believe to be the correct coded out amount. This can be corrected more than once if needed, but it  needs to be done before the final declaration is submitted. In software, this amendment is done by calling the [Create or Amend Coding Out Underpayments and Debt Amounts](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Coding-Out-Underpayments-and-Debts/paths/~1accounts~1self-assessment~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1collection~1tax-code/put) endpoint. This endpoint can only be used after the tax year has ended.

If the customer has submitted an amendment to the coded out amount after the end of the tax year but later realises they agree with the coded out amount shown by HMRC, they can delete their submitted amount. This deletion needs to be done before the final declaration is submitted. In software, this deletion is done by calling the [Delete Coding Out Underpayments and Debt Amounts](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Coding-Out-Underpayments-and-Debts/paths/~1accounts~1self-assessment~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1collection~1tax-code/delete) endpoint.
