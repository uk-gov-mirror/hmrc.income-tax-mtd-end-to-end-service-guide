# MTD terminology (style guide)

## Why we use a style guide

A style guide is a set of standards for writing content, which is used to ensure consistency. For example, someone might use one to check whether to write 'late filing penalty' or 'late submission penalty'.

This style guide is used across Making Tax Digital for Income Tax by people who write for HMRC 'customers' (taxpayers and agents).

It's not mandatory for anyone who's creating software to use these terms. However, we've made the style guide publicly available, so anyone can use terminology that:

- is consistent with GOV.UK and the Making Tax Digital for Income Tax service
- has been tested in usability research

This style guide is used alongside the:

- [Government Digital Service (GDS) style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style)
- [HMRC content style guide](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-content-style-guide/)

## Suggest a change or addition

If something's missing, unclear, or incorrect, you can suggest an addition, clarification or change to the style guide.

To suggest a change, email us at mtd-api-ur@hmrc.gov.uk. 

## A-Z

### abroad

Avoid using 'abroad'. Say 'outside the UK' instead.

### accounting methods

Use [cash basis accounting](#cash-basis-accounting) and [traditional accounting](#traditional-accounting) to refer to the two accounting methods. Do not say 'cash accounting'.

'Traditional accounting' is sometimes known as 'standard accounting' or 'accruals'. Do not use those terms unless you have evidence your users will be looking for them, and only add them for clarity - for example, 'traditional accounting' (also known as 'accruals').

Define the terms on each page where they're mentioned, especially when you ask people which method they use.

### agent services account

Use sentence case. Say 'agent services account', not 'Agent Services Account'.

### allowable and disallowable expenses

Where possible, say 'things you can claim tax relief on' and 'things you cannot claim tax relief on' instead of 'allowable expenses' and 'disallowable expenses'.

Use 'allowable expenses' and 'disallowable expenses' where necessary, and define the terms on each page where they're mentioned. Do not use alternatives like 'non-allowable expenses' or 'non-eligible expenses'.

### balancing payment

Use this instead of [remaining balance](#remaining-balance).

### cash basis accounting

See [accounting methods](#accounting-methods).

### charge reference number

Lower case.

### clients

Use 'your client' or 'clients' if you're describing the customers of an agent. For example, "You must talk to your client before you sign them up".

HMRC sometimes refers to people using their service as customers. However, agents or accountants refer to their customers as clients.

### coding out an underpayment

Do not use 'coding out an underpayment' in content for taxpayers. On first mention, say 'if you have underpaid tax you can pay what you owe through your PAYE tax code'. After that, use 'paying tax you owe through your tax code'.

In content for agents, say 'if your client has underpaid tax they can pay what they owe through their PAYE tax code'. After that, use 'paying tax they owe through their tax code'.

### create an agent services account

Use this term when users are asked to set up an agent services account.

### crystallisation

Do not use 'crystallisation'. See [final declaration](#final-declaration) for guidance on what to use instead.

### digital records

Do not say 'records that must be kept in a digital/electronic format'. Use 'digital records' instead.

### digital handshake

Do not use 'digital handshake'. Use 'authorisation link' - for example, 'ask your client to authorise you by creating an authorisation link'.

This is the process used to link an agent and client together.

### exempt, exemption

People can apply for an exemption from Making Tax Digital if they cannot keep digital records.

### final declaration

This is the final step of submitting a tax return within Making Tax Digital for Income Tax. It lets users confirm that every source of income has been submitted to HMRC and is accurate (to the best of their knowledge).

Do not use 'final declaration' when you're talking about the tax return in general. Use [tax return](#tax-return) instead.

The term 'final declaration' is used to refer to the final step of the tax return:

- in software
- in guidance, for example on GOV.UK
- within the service

For example, the final button in the process could be labelled 'Make your final declaration'. It should be clear this will submit a user's tax return to HMRC and they will not be able to make further changes without going through the amendment process.

Tell people to 'make' a final declaration rather than file, submit or send one.

### foreign

Say 'foreign', not 'overseas', unless you're talking about qualifying recognised overseas pension schemes (QROPS).

### HMRC online services

Avoid saying 'business tax account' or 'personal tax account' unless something can only be done in one of the services. Where possible, use the more general 'HMRC online services' instead.

### Income Tax

Initial caps.

### late filing penalty

Do not use 'late filing penalty'. Use [late submission penalty](#late-submission-penalty-second-late-submission-penalty).

### late submission penalty, second late submission penalty

Lower case.

### main agent

Not 'primary agent'.

### Making Tax Digital for Income Tax

Initial caps, except 'for'.

This is the name of the service. Do not use variations or alternatives, like 'Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment'.

### mandation

Do not use 'mandation' or 'mandated'. Say 'you must' and quote the date, if necessary, to give context. For example, say 'If you must use Making Tax Digital for Income Tax' rather than 'If you're a mandated customer'.

### Making Tax Digital

The service is called 'Making Tax Digital for Income Tax'. Do not use abbreviations or variations, like 'MTD for Income Tax' or 'Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment'.

Use the brand name 'Making Tax Digital' sparingly. Where necessary, use it to help people understand the difference between classic Self Assessment and Making Tax Digital for Income Tax in GOV.UK guidance.

Avoid using 'Making Tax Digital' in content once someone has signed up for it (unless you’re telling them HMRC has signed them up automatically, through a process that’s known internally as triggered migration). Focus on the task they’re trying to complete instead.

### MTD

Do not use the acronym 'MTD' in user-facing content. See [Making Tax Digital for Income Tax](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/mtd-terminology.html#making-tax-digital-for-income-tax).

### new penalties

Penalties in Making Tax Digital are not the same as penalties in classic Self Assessment.

When you refer to the new penalties, say 'our new penalties' and include a link to more information. Do not say 'points-based penalties', 'new penalty regime' or 'new penalty system'.

### nil return

Not 'nil-return'.

Avoid saying 'nil return' where possible. For example, instead of saying 'You must submit a nil return where applicable', say 'You must send a quarterly update, even if you do not have any income or expenses to report'.

### opt out of Making Tax Digital

When someone chooses to move from quarterly reporting to annual reporting, they opt out of Making Tax Digital for Income Tax. This is only an option if they:

- signed up for Making Tax Digital for Income Tax voluntarily
- haven't exceeded the income threshold since they joined

### payment on account

Do not say 'payment on account 1' and 'payment on account 2', because people think it means they have 2 accounts. Use 'first payment on account' and 'second payment on account' instead.

Do not assume people know what a payment on account is. Where possible, define it on each page where it's used.

For example, say 'Payments on account are advance payments towards your next tax bill.' If you have more space, say:

	Payments on account are 2 advance payments made towards your next tax bill. They pay for:

		- Income Tax
		- [Class 4 National Insurance contributions](https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates) (opens in new tab)

	HMRC estimates the total amount based on your previous year’s tax bill. Each payment is half of that amount.

### payment plan

Lower case.

### points-based penalties

Do not use. Use [new penalties](#new-penalties) instead.

### post-mandation

Do not use 'post-mandation'. Say 'you must' and quote the date, if necessary, to give context.

### qualifying income

Someone's qualifying income is their total income from self-employment and property. It's assessed using their gross income (also called 'turnover') before they deduct any expenses.

Do not say 'qualifying income' without defining it or linking to more information.

Avoid mentioning 'qualifying income' if you can avoid it. For example, say 'You'll have to send quarterly updates if you need to use Making Tax Digital for Income Tax' rather than 'You'll have to send quarterly updates if your qualifying income exceeds the threshold'.

### quarterly update

This is a summary of someone's business income and expenses, which they share with HMRC through software.

You can say [update](#update) rather than 'quarterly update' where it's clear in context - for example, on buttons or in other microcopy. But use 'quarterly update' whenever you:

- are introducing or defining the concept
- think it helps make things clearer

Tell people to 'send' a quarterly update rather than share or submit one. In guidance on how to use Making Tax Digital for Income Tax, it's OK to continue describing the quarterly update as sharing information with HMRC.

### refund

Use 'refund', not 'repayment', in the context of Making Tax Digital for Income Tax.

### regime

Avoid saying 'regime'.

For example, do not say 'Making Tax Digital for Income Tax is a new tax regime'. Say 'Making Tax Digital for Income Tax is a new way to report income to HMRC' instead.

### remuneration

Not renumeration.

### Rent-a-Room relief

Upper case 'R' and 'R', lower case 'a', 2 hyphens.

### register

Do not use 'register'. Use [sign up](#sign-up). For example, 'sign your client up to Making Tax Digital'.

### remaining balance

Do not use 'remaining balance'. Use [balancing payment](#balancing-payment).

### return amendments

Do not refer to correcting a final declaration. Talk about correcting a tax return instead.

You can tell people that they can correct, amend or change their return. Avoid saying they can 'update' a return to avoid confusion with a quarterly update.

### Self Assessment

Not 'self-assessment'.

### self-employment

Hyphenate this noun.

### sign up

See [register](#register).

### submission

Where possible, be specific - say [quarterly update](#quarterly-update), [tax return](#tax-return) or [final declaration](#final-declaration). Avoid 'submission', unless you're talking about a submission deadline or a late submission penalty (which could be for a quarterly update or a final declaration).

### supporting agent

Not secondary agent.

### tax adjustments, allowance adjustments

Lower case.

Research with users suggests this term is confusing in some contexts. We're exploring alternatives and will update this entry when we know more.

### tax return

See [final declaration](#final-declaration).

### time to pay agreement

Do not use 'time to pay agreement'. Use [payment plan](#payment-plan) instead.

### traders or taxpayers

Do not use 'traders' or 'taxpayers' in customer-facing content. Instead address the user as 'you' - say "You can contact HMRC by phone and email", for example.

If you're writing content for agents, see [clients](#clients).

### traditional accounting

See [accounting methods](#accounting-methods).

### update

See [quarterly update](#quarterly-update).

### update period

Users' quarterly updates will cover an 'update period'. They will use either:

- standard update periods (6 April to 5 July, 6 July to 5 October, 6 October to 5 January, 6 January to 5 April)
- calendar update periods (1 April to 30 June, 1 July to 30 September, 1 October to 31 December, 1 January to 31 March)

Do not use 'month end elect' or 'month end election'. Say 'choose between standard or calendar update periods' instead.
