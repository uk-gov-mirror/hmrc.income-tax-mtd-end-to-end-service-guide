# Tax calculations

As part of MTD, software providers can retrieve tax calculations directly from HMRC. HMRC calculates in-year estimates, annual forecasts and end-of-year tax calculations (final declaration). The calculation retrieved by the software is the same as the one used by HMRC. 

The customer can check their tax calculation at any time during the year. All the Self Assessment tax calculation endpoints are available in the [Individual Calculations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/). There are several messages built into the API that provide guidance and explanations to customers, for example: 

- ‘Your Basic Rate limit has been increased by £8,012.11 to £375,000.00 for Pension Contribution’
- ‘One or more of your annual adjustments have not been applied because you have submitted additional income or expenses’

## Retrieving a tax calculation

When a customer wants to view a new tax calculation, the software should use the Calculation ID to retrieve it by calling the [Retrieve Self Assessment Tax Calculation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1{nino}~1self-assessment~1{taxYear}~1{calculationId}/get) endpoint. If the software does not yet have this ID, it should call the [Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1{nino}~1self-assessment~1{taxYear}/post) endpoint to trigger it. After a successful API call, HMRC will provide a Calculation ID that can be used to retrieve the calculation output.

The retrieval can take around 5 seconds, so to avoid getting an error the software should wait at least 5 seconds before attempting to retrieve the calculation. The software then uses the ID to retrieve the calculation by calling the [Retrieve Self Assessment Tax Calculation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1{nino}~1self-assessment~1{taxYear}~1{calculationId}/get) endpoint. 

When a customer requests to view an existing calculation, the software should call the [List Self Assessment Tax Calculations](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1{nino}~1self-assessment/get) endpoint to list all the tax calculations for a given year. This endpoint lists the software-triggered calculations and HMRC-triggered calculations, including any that have failed. From the list, the customer can choose the specific calculation for which they need more details. The software then uses the Calculation ID to retrieve the complete calculation output by calling the [Retrieve Self Assessment Tax Calculation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1{nino}~1self-assessment~1{taxYear}~1{calculationId}/get) endpoint. 

If the software retrieves a calculation, it will cover only the period up to their last submission date, not the calculation retrieval date. For example, if a customer submitted their update to 1 July 2023 and they requested a calculation on 30 July 2023, they will receive a calculation only up to 1 July 2023.

### Calculations that produce errors

HMRC validates the information submitted by the software by checking the data quality and data integrity. These checks include both technical (schema) specifications and business-related factors to ensure that the data is complete and meaningful. Any validation errors will be returned by using the [Retrieve a Self Assessment Tax Calculation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1{nino}~1self-assessment~1{taxYear}~1{calculationId}/get) endpoint. The software should make sure that the validation errors are presented to the customer.

If there are validation errors, no calculation results are generated. For example, it is possible that errors in previously submitted data can prevent a calculation being performed.

To prevent the validation errors from being generated, the customer must amend their digital records. The software should resubmit the revised summary totals for the relevant periods and then call the [Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1{nino}~1self-assessment~1{taxYear}/post) endpoint.

### Calculations that are free from errors

If there are no errors, the results of the calculation are available.

The calculation output provides a summary of each income source (for example, self-employment, UK property, foreign property, and UK bank and building society interest) and a breakdown of allowances and reliefs applied. It also includes a breakdown of the Income Tax and NIC payable. This calculation output also includes additional income submitted by the customer through their software or [HMRC online services]( /guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tasks-outside-mtd-software.html#hmrc-online-services) and information held by HMRC.

If the customer retrieves a tax calculation during the year, it is an estimated forecast and they do not need to pay any tax at this time. They will pay tax after submitting their final declaration.

If a software provider identifies what they think could be a problem with the [Individual Calculations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api), they will need to contact [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk).

## HMRC Assist

<!--- Section owner: Transactional Risking --->

HMRC Assist is a new digital service to support customers using Making Tax Digital (MTD) Income Tax Self-Assessment (ITSA) software. The goal of HMRC Assist is to ensure that customers get their tax returns right the first time. It will analyse information provided through quarterly updates and other data that HMRC holds, such as PAYE information from Real Time Information (RTI) submissions. Based on this data, HMRC Assist provides tailored feedback to customers to help them with their tax returns.

The service will supplement any existing guidance within software by using data available to HMRC to provide personalised feedback messages on the information submitted on quarterly updates and final declarations.

This service will be accessible to customers and agents through compatible third-party software and [HMRC online services]( /guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tasks-outside-mtd-software.html#hmrc-online-services). As a software provider, you will be able to integrate HMRC Assist into your MTD ITSA-compatible product using the [Self Assessment Assist API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-assist/). Once integrated, customers or their agents submitting information using software can request feedback messages. HMRC Assist will then review the data and provide feedback and suggested actions to ensure accurate tax reporting. Additionally, the service may include links to helpful guidance on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs)

For example, if HMRC data suggests that rental income should be declared but has not been, a feedback message may prompt the customer to declare it. Similarly, the service will highlight any tax reliefs or allowances to which the customer may be entitled. While this feature is optional for MTD software, it is expected to meet market demand due to its benefits, including improving the customer experience and increasing accuracy in tax filings.

### Produce an HMRC Self Assessment assist report

The report contains targeted feedback based on what the customer advises HMRC in their update for the given National Insurance number (NINO), Calculation ID, and tax year.
