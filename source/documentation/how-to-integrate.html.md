# How to integrate with HMRC APIs

## Minimum functionality standards

For the customer to complete the end-to-end journey, we expect Making Tax Digital for Income Tax- compatible software products to facilitate the entire journey either in a single product covering the below requirements or through a number of products collectively meeting the below functionalities:

- provide HMRC with transaction monitoring fraud prevention header data
- obtain business ID unique to each of the customer’s businesses
- create and maintain all digital records (or digitally link to a product that can do so) that a customer is required to keep by law in digital form - as per the [terms of use](/api-documentation/docs/terms-of-use), end users should own and have access to all their records created and be able to export these records, if necessary
- submit quarterly update information for each mandated business income source (self-employment, multiple self-employments, UK property income and/or foreign property income)
- allow customers to view an estimate of their income tax liability by either signposting them to their HMRC account or by displaying it in software - if the latter, the estimate must be presented with a disclaimer as to its accuracy 
- make required adjustments and finalise business income for the year
- brought forward, carry forward or set sideways (when permitted) business losses occurring in any one year as well as to apply losses incurred in earlier years against current year profits
- make a final declaration or divert a customer into a channel where they can make it
- divert customers into a different service for any non-mandated income sources which are not supported within the software to be declared

The Making Tax Digital for Income Tax APIs that include the endpoints for the functionality described above are:

- [Business Details](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/)
- [Business Source Adjustable Summary](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-bsas-api)
- [Individual Calculations](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api)
- [Individual Losses](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-losses-api)
- [Obligations](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/obligations-api/)
- [Property Business](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/property-business-api/) 
- [Self-Employment Business](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-employment-business-api/)

### Additional functionality

HMRC will be providing tailored feedback messaging through nudges and prompts that software providers can incorporate into their software to support customers with their tax affairs. This is known as [HMRC Assist](/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tax-calculations.html#hmrc-assist). We encourage software providers to build meaningful prompts and nudges into their software products to support the customer journey and drive compliant behaviours.

In addition, software providers may wish to offer other functionality over and above the minimum standards. This could include automated functionality, for example, automated quarterly updates. Where this is the case, customers remain legally responsible for meeting their quarterly obligations, and HMRC would expect appropriate safeguards to be built in.

### Software Choices

Software Choices is a service designed to help users [find compatible software for Making Tax Digital for Income Tax](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax) that meets their needs.

An updated Software Choices page will feature filters to help users find appropriate products to support their Making Tax Digital needs.

Only products that meet the minimum functionality standards, either individually or in conjunction with other pieces of software, will feature on the Software Choices page. We are considering how we can best ensure customers are able to find products which cater for the full end to end journey. Customers will also be able to search for software products compatible with Making Tax Digital for VAT.

## Process for being granted Production access

### Fraud prevention headers

It is a legal requirement for software to provide compliant fraud prevention header information for all Making Tax Digital for Income Tax APIs. This requirement must be fulfilled before Production access to the APIs can be granted.

HMRC must see evidence that your software sends fraud prevention headers and must be satisfied with their level of accuracy. Before you start developing your Making Tax Digital for Income Tax-compatible software, we recommend you check whether your technology stack supports the collection of all header data required. For more guidance on fraud prevention headers, refer to [Send fraud prevention data (GOV.UK)](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/fraud-prevention/).

### Terms of use

If you are creating a new Production application, you must comply with our [terms of use](/api-documentation/docs/terms-of-use) before we can issue you with Production credentials. 

### Overview of developer journey to Production accesss

1. Sign into the  [Developer Hub](/api-documentation) and register your application for Sandbox testing.
2. [Create a test user which is an individual](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0/oas/page#tag/create-test-user/operation/Createatestuserwhichisanindividual) to create test data.
3. Review the [API documentation](/api-documentation/docs/api?filter=income-tax-mtd) and this guide.
4. Develop your software application. Any queries during this phase should be sent to [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk).
5. Register your application for Production credentials by creating a Production application within your HMRC Developer Hub account. Alternatively, if you already have an existing Production application, you should add the relevant API subscriptions to it.
6. Test the software in the Sandbox and provide credentials used for testing to HMRC.
7. Complete and return the Production Approvals Checklist issued to you by HMRC. 
8. HMRC will review the developer testing (including fraud header validity) and the completed Production Approvals Checklist:
    - if satisfactory, you will be granted Production access to the requested APIs
    - if not satisfactory, HMRC will contact you to advise what action is required

### Product build

There are 3 different types of products that can be built:

- full end-to-end product
- in-year product
- end-of-year product

#### Full end-to-end product

Software providers have the option to either build all elements required to meet [minimum functionality standards](#minimum-functionality-standards) in one go or to build these elements iteratively. If you choose to build iteratively, you are required to test the relevant APIs and complete the Production Approvals Checklist for the appropriate stage of the build.

For a full end-to-end product, there are 2 distinct stages and the APIs required for each are:

- In-year functionality (submitting periodic updates):

  - Business Details (MTD)
  - Obligations (MTD)
  - Self-Employment Business (MTD) and/or Property Business (MTD) 
  -  Individual Calculations (MTD) - if displaying calculation in software and not signposting customers to their HMRC account 

- End-of-year functionality:

  - Self-Employment Business (MTD) and/or Property Business (MTD) - if including annual submission endpoints in end-of-year build 
  - Business Source Adjustable Summary (MTD)
  - Individual Losses (MTD)
  - Obligations (MTD) - if supporting final declaration
  - Individual Calculations (MTD) - if supporting final declaration in software and not diverting customers into a channel where they can submit it

#### In-year product 

The APIs required are:

- Business Details (MTD)
- Obligations (MTD)
- Self-Employment Business (MTD) and/or Property Business (MTD) 
- Individual Calculations (MTD) - if displaying calculation in software and not signposting customers to their HMRC account 

#### End-of-year product

The APIs required are:

- Business Details (MTD)
- Self-Employment Business (MTD) and/or Property Business (MTD) - annual submission endpoints
- Business Source Adjustable Summary (MTD)
- Individual Losses (MTD)
- Obligations (MTD) – if supporting final declaration
- Individual Calculations (MTD) - if supporting final declaration in software and not diverting customers into a channel where they can submit it

### Testing requirements

HMRC requires software providers to test all the API endpoints to which they need access. The following guidelines apply to accessing new API subscriptions and version updates of existing API subscriptions.

For APIs included in the [minimum functionality standards](#minimum-functionality-standards):

- you are required to test all endpoints shown within the documentation 
- ensure it aligns with the information in your completed Production Approvals Checklist

For APIs not included in the minimum functionality standards:

- you are required to test only the endpoints relating to the data sources that your software supports 
- if your software does not support all data items, please notify  [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk) separately to confirm which data items you do support, so we can take this into account when checking the testing logs

[Fraud prevention headers](/guides/fraud-prevention/) must be included in Sandbox calls, which will be checked by a specialist team. Once testing is complete, please send details of the dummy National Insurance Number used in the Sandbox to  [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk). You will need to contact us within 14 days of completing your API testing to enable us to view the data within our logs.  

### Production Approvals Checklist

HMRC will issue a Production Approvals Checklist asking for details about your software. This must be completed and returned to [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk).

Production access will be granted after we are satisfied that:

- the relevant APIs and endpoints have been tested satisfactorily
- calls include compliant fraud prevention headers
- the Checklist is completed satisfactorily and aligns with the testing

For access to updated APIs (that is, new versions), we do not generally require a new Production Approvals Checklist but do need to see evidence of satisfactory testing.

**Note:** It is important to build relevant error responses in your software to handle exceptions.

##  Sandbox testing

Some APIs in the Sandbox environment allow software to test different scenarios by including ‘Gov-Test-Scenario’ headers in requests. The [Making Tax Digital for Income Tax API documentation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api?filter=income-tax-mtd) provides more information about how to use these test scenarios.

####  Dynamic scenarios

Dynamic scenarios return a response that changes depending on the parameters submitted by software, for example National Insurance number or tax year. However, the submitted data is not stored for future requests and does not affect the behaviour of other endpoints.

####  Stateful scenarios

Stateful scenarios work across groups of endpoints.

With a stateful test scenario, you can submit custom data and then retrieve or list it from a different endpoint. For example, you can submit test data through the [Self-Employment Business API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-employment-business-api/), and then request a summary using the [Business Source Adjustable Summary API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-bsas-api/) for the same business. 

The Sandbox environment retains test data you submit for 7 days after submission, after which it is deleted automatically.

#### Stateful Sandbox user journey

## Supporting customers in MTD

The customer support model guides HMRC customers to the most appropriate support. Check [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees) and the software provider's guidance first.

Customers who have signed up to the MTD pilot can get support by contacting the dedicated Customer Support Team on 0300 322 9619 from 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday. 

We aim to respond to queries that are not resolved at the point of contact within 2 days, and to provide further updates, if required, every 2 working days.

## API lifecycle and deprecation

Each Making Tax Digital for Income Tax API follows a lifecycle from the point where it is first published to the point where it is retired.

More specifically, every version of each API follows a lifecycle. Different versions of the same API can be at different points in the lifecycle. For example, v1.0 might be retired, v2.0 might be stable and v3.0 might be in beta.

### API status

The following table provides details about possible API statuses.

| Status | Meaning | Documentation visible? | Can be subscribed to in Developer Hub? | Endpoints enabled? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha| Early prototype - documentation only, available in External Test. Intended for feedback about the initial API design and documentation. Expect breaking changes and behaviour changes. | Yes | No | No |
| Beta | Live service but not stable. Breaking changes and behaviour changes are possible. | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Stable | Stable live service. No breaking changes and only minor behaviour changes. | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Deprecated | Set to be retired, either because a new version of the API is available or because the API is no longer supported. If applicable, a new version of the API will be available in external test when the current version is deprecated. | Yes (see note) | No | Yes |
| Retired | API is no longer in use. | No | No | No |

**Note:** If all versions of an API are deprecated, it no longer appears on the [list of APIs](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api?filter=income-tax-mtd) unless you are signed in to the Developer Hub and have an active subscription to that API. You can still access the API documentation directly without being signed in.

### Breaking changes

Any change that might break software that relies on an API is counted as breaking change.

The following table  lists changes that we consider breaking. 

| Area | Breaking changes |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| Query Parameter | <ul><li>Adding mandatory query parameter</li><li>Removing a query parameter</li><li>Renaming a query parameter</li><li>Changing an optional query parameter to be mandatory</li><li>Removing/renaming a value from an enum</li></ul> |
| Request Body | <ul><li> Adding a mandatory field </li><li> Removing a field </li><li> Renaming a field </li><li> Changing an optional field to be mandatory </li><li> Removing/renaming a value from an enum</li></ul> |
| Response Body | <ul><li> Removing a field </li><li> Renaming a field </li><li> Changing a mandatory field to be optional </li><li> Adding/renaming a value to an enum</li></ul> |
| Other | <ul><li> Changing the URL of the endpoint </li><li> Removing a resource/endpoint </li><li> Changing the semantics of a field value (for example, the value returned changes from inclusive of VAT to exclusive of VAT) </li><li> Changing validation to have stronger constraints</li></ul> |

#### Changes to errors

When we make changes to errors, we will not usually change the JSON structure returned. In the rare case when this is necessary, this will be considered a breaking change. The values of the error fields may change. 

The following table outlines which types of changes to errors are treated as breaking changes and which are not.

| Breaking changes for errors | Non-breaking changes for errors  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Changing the HTTP status code to a different value | Removing an error code |
| Renaming an error code | Changing the message of an error |
| Adding a new error code (but see below) | |

If we add a new error code to an endpoint as part of a new field/object, which is not itself a breaking change, the new error is not counted as a breaking change.

For example, if we add a new optional string field to the request body and the field must satisfy a specific condition (otherwise, it fails with a new error), this error is not considered a breaking change because existing software will keep functioning as the error can be returned only if the new field is used.

### Deprecating APIs

If an API has been in production with a status of 'Stable', we aim for a deprecation period of 6 months. 

For an API in beta, we aim for a deprecation period of 6 weeks minimum.

Applications cannot subscribe to a deprecated API version, but can still call the API version if the subscription was made before the status changed.

The status of APIs is indicated in the API documentation. 

### Indicating deprecation in headers

For releases after January 2024, when an endpoint becomes deprecated, it will return the following response headers.

| Name | Meaning | Example value |
| ---- | ------- | ------------- |
| Deprecation | The deprecation date/time for this endpoint, in IMF-fixdate format. | `Sun, 01 Jan 2023 23:59:59 GMT` |
| Sunset | (optional) The earliest date/time this endpoint will become unavailable after deprecation, in IMF-fixdate format. | `Sun, 02 Jul 2023 23:59:59 GMT` |
| Link | Documentation URL for the relevant API | `https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api` |

The 'Sunset' header contains the earliest date/time that the endpoint could be retired after being deprecated. Do not rely on the availability of the endpoint after this.

The 'Sunset' header may not be returned in some rare cases, such as when the retirement date for an endpoint is uncertain.

#### Older deprecation headers

In previous releases, deprecation status could be indicated with a 'Deprecation' response header like this.

| Name | Example value |
| ---- | ------------- |
| Deprecation | This endpoint is deprecated. See the [API documentation](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-bsas-api/). |

**Note:** This was implemented only for the Business Source Adjustable Summary API.

### Retiring APIs

After an API has been deprecated for the amounts of time indicated above, it can be retired and the endpoints and documentation will be removed. Ensure that your application does not rely on any deprecated APIs.
