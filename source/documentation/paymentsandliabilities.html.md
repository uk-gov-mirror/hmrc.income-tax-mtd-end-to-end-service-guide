# Payments and Liabilities
 
The Self Assessment Account API allows a developer to retrieve accounting information to be shown back to the customer. This includes listing payments the customer has made, how these payments have been allocated and details of any upcoming or outstanding liabilities. Here a developer can:

* retrieve the overall liability broken down into overdue, payable and pending amounts
* retrieve a list of charges and payments for a given date range
* list self-assessment charges between two dates
* retrieve the history of changes to an individual charge
* retrieve a list of payments for a given date range
* retrieve the allocation details of a specific payment against one or more liabilities
