# Income Tax Self Assessment end-to-end service guide

Version 1.0 issued XX December 2019
***

This service guide is to help software designers and vendors understand how their software fits in with HMRC APIs.
It covers elements of the service delivered by HMRC to show how the Income Tax end-to-end service works.

Product owners, developers and business analysts can also use this guide to learn more about Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment (ITSA).

## Overview

Making Tax Digital (MTD) for Income Tax is a service that will improve Self Assessment for the 7 million businesses that currently submit a tax return.

Like MTD for VAT, MTD for Income Tax requires businesses and landlords to keep their records digitally and submit information about business income to HMRC using MTD-compatible software. 

The other major change is that businesses and landlords will no longer send an annual tax return. Instead, they will be required to send HMRC quarterly summary updates of their business income and expenditure, and complete a process to finalise their overall tax position at the end of the year. They will receive a view of their emerging tax position based on the information provided, helping them budget for their tax better throughout the year. There are no changes to payment dates.

Customers will be mandated to provide the following information through software:

* income and expenses for each self-employment and property businesses at least every 3 months
* allowances and adjustments for each self-employment and property business at least once a year, at the end of the accounting period
* finalisation of business income sources with an End of Period Statement (EPS)

HMRC expects all software providers to also offer customers the ability to finalise their overall tax  position using software. This process is sometimes called crystallisation.

In the future, partnerships will be required to provide the information mentioned above for the partnership. Individual partners will not be mandated to report their partner income quarterly.

HMRC are also providing the APIs for software to support all of the personal data items that need to be submitted under Self Assessment. Although these elements will not be mandated through software, there will be demand for software that enables any user to finalise the entirety of their tax affairs.

By developing a product now, you will support mandation of the service, influence its design and ensure you have a product ready for the millions of business and agents that will need MTD compatible software.

## Terms of use

Your application must comply with our [terms of use](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/terms-of-use). You must accept the terms of use before we issue your applications production credentials.

## Software choices

HMRC publishes a [list of compatible software](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital-software-suppliers-terms-of-collaboration/terms-of-collaboration-between-hm-revenue-and-customs-and-software-developers#Annex-C) for Making Tax Digital for Income Tax on GOV.UK. Software vendors will be added to this list when they have completed the necessary steps in the ‘Software vendor overview’ section. 

From our experience with MTD VAT, businesses, agents, and third parties will use this as the definitive list of MTD compatible software. All software listed on the page must allow the user to submit a summary of business or property information up to and including the End of Period Statement. 

The current page will be developed over time to meet user needs, including filters that help users to find software. 

HMRC expects demand for products that serve all of the requirements of MTD, including keeping the required digital records for business or property income and the ability to submit all relevant non-business information to HMRC. 

HMRC has committed to the [availability of free software](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital-software-suppliers-terms-of-collaboration/terms-of-collaboration-between-hm-revenue-and-customs-and-software-developers#Annex-C) for small businesses.
