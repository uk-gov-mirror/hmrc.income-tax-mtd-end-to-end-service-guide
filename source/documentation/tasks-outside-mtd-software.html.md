# Tasks outside MTD software

## HMRC online services

Self Assessment customers who have signed up for Making Tax Digital for Income Tax can [sign into HMRC online services](https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services) to access relevant services. Customers can reach their Making Tax Digital account by clicking the **Making Tax Digital for Income Tax** link.

Software providers need to design a customer journey between software and HMRC online services. Whenever the journey takes the customer to HMRC online services, the service should open in a new browser window. This will allow customers to complete additional tasks not available in the software.

The following table lists the tasks customers will be able to complete through HMRC online services and/or compatible software. For each task, there is a brief explanation about the choice of service (HMRC online services or software or both) used to make the functionality available to customers.

Agents will be able to access Making Tax Digital for Income Tax services through their agent services account. They will be able to access all current and future services on behalf of their clients including the services listed in the above table, except for:

- changing their client’s bank details for refunds
- changing their client’s contact preference
- setting up a time-to-pay arrangement or budget payment plan

### Changing contact preference

To make MTD communication accessible to all customers, HMRC has provided them with a contact preference for paper or digital methods.  If customers have selected a digital preference, they will be able to view communications sent to them by HMRC through a secure mailbox accessible through HMRC online services.  HMRC encourages customers to sign up for digital messages as they will get reminders for when to make different updates and payments, which is not available through paper messages. 

### Changing the amount of payments on account

'Payments on account' (POA) are advance payments towards a customer's tax bill. For more information, refer to [Understand your Self-Assessment tax bill (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/understand-self-assessment-bill/payments-on-account).

When a customer makes their final declaration for the previous tax year, the POAs for the current tax year are calculated. If they believe the amount to be incorrect, they can make a claim to adjust the POAs using [HMRC online services (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services). 

When the customer adjusts the POA for the first time in a tax year, they can only reduce the POA amount. After that, they can either increase or decrease it. However, the increase is limited to the maximum value with which the POA was originally calculated. The updated POA values replace the existing ones and can be retrieved using the [Retrieve Self Assessment Balance and Transactions](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/3.0/oas/page#tag/Payments-and-Liabilities/paths/~1accounts~1self-assessment~1%7Bnino%7D~1balance-and-transactions/get) endpoint.

POAs can be adjusted throughout the tax year. However, all adjustments must be made before the customer makes their final declaration (or by 31st January following the end of that tax year). These changes are not dependent on any [customer status](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/prepare-for-mtd.html#mtd-customer-status).

### Adding new business details for a self-employment sole trader or property business

New self-employment and property businesses can be added using HMRC online services as soon as the business has started. Customers will have a grace period of up to 2 years before the business is included in MTD if the total qualifying income from all business income is over the MTD threshold.  If a customer adds the new business within the 2-year grace period, they can choose to bring it into MTD immediately and commence voluntary quarterly updates or can decide to keep it outside of MTD and submit the income annually after the year end as normal on their SA return.

After a new business is added, it can be seen almost immediately in software when the next API call is made to the [Business Details API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/). Customers can submit updates or an annual return for this new business on the same day.

Customers need to provide the following information to add a new business source.

| Self-employment | UK and foreign property |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Start date | Start date |
| Business address | Accounting method |
| Nature of business |  |
| Business name |  |
| Accounting method |  |

If the customer has more than one self-employment source, they all must have the same accounting method.

### Closing (ceasing) a self-employment sole trader or property business

Self-employment and property businesses can be ceased by entering the date the business ended using HMRC online services. However, when ceasing a property business, the customer needs to do this only when they no longer receive any type of rental income from all of their properties. Customers within MTD will be required to submit quarterly updates for the periods up to the date the business ended and any future quarterly obligations will be removed. After a business ceases, customers will not report post-cessation receipts or expenses through subsequent quarterly updates. Additional guidance on their reporting will be provided in due course.

Customers must update HMRC online services with the cease date as soon as possible to avoid late penalties that could be raised against future quarterly obligations. 

After a business has been updated as ceased, it can be seen almost immediately in software when the next API call is made to the [Business Details API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/). Customers can submit updates or an annual return for this new business on the same day.

In the future, it will be possible to reopen a closed business or change an incorrectly entered end date.

## Making a payment

Customers can make payments towards their liability as described in [Pay your Self Assessment tax bill (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill). Payments cannot currently be made through software. However, once a payment has been made, customers can view it both in software (through the [Self Assessment Accounts API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/)) and using [HMRC online services (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services).

When a payment is made, the current payment service will first check to see if there is any outstanding liability from previous Self Assessment Tax returns, and it will prioritise the allocation of funds there.  Following that allocation, if there is any payment remaining, it will be allocated to any unpaid Payment on account charges  or  owed liability following an MTD final declaration.  If those remaining funds do not fully cover that MTD liability, this still must  be paid by 31 January.  In this instance, the [Self Assessment Accounts API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/) can be used through software to see how much of their MTD liability is outstanding. However, it will not show them the amount that has been apportioned to previous tax year Self Assessment returns.  To view this, a customer will need to access [HMRC online services](#hmrc-online-services).   

## Claiming a refund

For current MTD customers, a refund must be claimed by contacting HMRC. Claiming a refund through [HMRC online services](#hmrc-online-services) is scheduled for future development and we will provide further information here when available.

## Opting out of MTD

Customers who are in MTD on a voluntary basis can leave (opt out) at any time. When this happens the customer’s filing obligations will change from MTD (quarterly) to a single annual obligation due on 31 January following the end of the tax year - this is their final declaration. It is important to note that even if a customer opts out of MTD, they can continue using the software as long as it supports submission for annual self-employment and property income.

Eligibility to opt out is determined on a tax year basis. For example, a customer can be mandated for the current year and voluntary for the next year, meaning the customer could opt out next year. A customer can opt out for the previous tax year if they signed up to MTD as a voluntary customer, then subsequently decided not to submit quarterly - opting out would allow the customer to file on an annual basis for that year.

The opt-out service will not be available through an API. Customers and agents must use different methods to view any changes to filing obligations.

| User type | Method |
| --------- | ------ |
| Customer | Use their [HMRC online services](#hmrc-online-services) account to access the opt-out service and view their changed obligations immediately. |
| Agent | Use their agent services account to access their client’s account. Changed obligations will be viewable immediately in their software. |

If the customer has submitted updates of business income and expenses (self-employment and/or property) through their software for the tax year they opt out of MTD, these updates will be deleted. The customer or their agent will receive a warning message to inform them that this is going to happen. The total business income and expenses (for the tax year) must then be submitted as part of the customer’s tax return before completing their final declaration.

If a customer is mandated to be in MTD, they will not be eligible to opt out. The opt-out service will be available in [HMRC online services](#hmrc-online-services) only for eligible customers.
